Why Go?
    1. Concurrency
        Built for concurrency
        language features
            go, select & range, chan, <-

    2. Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
        go, type, package, import, func, main, var, const, if, else, switch, case, break, continue, for, make, new, close, chan, select, return
        1. No access modifiers (public private etc)
        2. No classes (only structs & functions)
        3. No inheritance (only composition)
        4. No exceptions (only errors)
        5. Everything is passed by value by default (use pointers to pass by reference)
        6. No Pointer arithmetic

    3. Efficiency & Performance
